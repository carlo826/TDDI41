Exercise 2:
2-1 Explain the concept of "stratum" in a clock hierarchy (e.g. NTP, but also synchronized networks and other clock hierarchies).Why is it necessary to have a hierarchy of clocks rather than just a bunch of reference clocks.
Stratum is the level that a clock exists on, a clock may get updates from the stratum above it and update the clocks for the stratum below them. For example a clock on stratum 2 may only recieve updates from a clock on stratum 1 and only update the times of clocks on stratum 3. Maintaining a hierarchy of clock prevents the "master" clock from being overloaded.


2-2 How large a difference between the reference clock and the system clock does NTP accept and attempt to adjust.
The default maximum time difference is 1000s.


2-3 NTP usually works by speeding up or slowing down the clock, not setting it outright. Why.
This is done to prevent time jumps (periods of time that "doesnt exist").


Exercise 3:
3-3 Explain the output of ntpq -p.
remote: Where the client is synchronized to. (For our client this is the ip of the router). The * before the name means its the server we are synchonized to.
refid: What the remote server is synchonized to. For our client this is 162.159.200.1 which is the remote for the router
st: stratum level
t: type both the client and the server have u meaning they are unicast
when: number of seconds since last response
poll: how often the client polls the NTP server
reach: 8-bit register that shows packet history. When a packet is recieved the rightmost bit is set to 1, when a packet is recieved the value is set to 0.
delay: the round-trip time in milliseconds
offset: the time difference in milliseconds between the client and the server
jitter: the time difference in milliseconds between the last two samples.
