Exercise 2:
2-1 Explain the concept of "stratum" in a clock hierarchy (e.g. NTP, but also synchronized networks and other clock hierarchies).Why is it necessary to have a hierarchy of clocks rather than just a bunch of reference clocks.
Stratum is the level that a clock exists on, a clock may get updates from the stratum above it and update the clocks for the stratum below them. For example a clock on stratum 2 may only recieve updates from a clock on stratum 1 and only update the times of clocks on stratum 3. Maintaining a hierarchy of clock prevents the "master" clock from being overloaded.


2-2 How large a difference between the reference clock and the system clock does NTP accept and attempt to adjust.
The default maximum time difference is 1000s.


2-3 NTP usually works by speeding up or slowing down the clock, not setting it outright. Why.
This is done to prevent time jumps (periods of time that "doesnt exist").
