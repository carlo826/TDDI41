11-1 Why is RAID 1+0 generally considered more reliable than RAID 0+1.
Raid 1+0 is more reliable since the disks are divided between more groups.

11-2 As individual disk sizes grow, RAID-5 is no longer considered useful, and RAID-6 is also rapidly becoming obsolete. Why.
Because if one disk fails you have to be able to read every byte from all other disk and since disk sizes are large there is a higher risk of read failure.

11-3 What is the point of the file system journal in e.g. ext3.
It can restore the filesystem way faster and with a lower chance of corruption after a crash.

11-4 Explain the purpose of using a volume manager, like LVM.
LVM allows grouping of multiple physical drives into logical drives, increasing abstraction and flexibility.
